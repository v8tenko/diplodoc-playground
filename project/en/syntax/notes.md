# Notes

A note is a highlighted block that contains important information.

Depending on the content, notes with different titles and formatting are used:

* Note: Additional information.
* Advice: A recommendation.
* Important: A warning.
* Attention: A restriction.
* A note with its own header.

Notes can include any YFM markup, but we don't recommend overloading them with elements. Choose a simple design and don't overuse notes because this will distract the user from the main content.
