# Single-page build

You can build an entire project as a single HTML file. To do this, when executing the `yfm` command, specify the `--single-page` startup key.

{% note warning "Beta function" %}

This is currently a beta function, so it may not work well on large projects with a complex structure. If you have any problems, let us know on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/yfm-docs/issues).
