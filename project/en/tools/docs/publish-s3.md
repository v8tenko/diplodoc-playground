# Uploading to S3

You can configure the building so that the documentation is automatically uploaded to [S3 storage](https://cloud.yandex.com/services/storage). To do this, when executing the `yfm` command, specify the `--publish` startup key.

You can set layout settings in one of the following ways:

* Using startup keys: The name of the key corresponds to the name of the setting.
* In a [configuration file](../../project/config.md).
