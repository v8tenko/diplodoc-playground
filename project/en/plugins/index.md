# Plugins

Besides the basic [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/) syntax, YFM provides a set of plugins with additional features and unique markup elements.

{% note warning %}

The order of plugins is important. When adding plugins, you should specify the full set of plugins

{% endnote %}

{% include [plugins.md](../_includes/plugins.md) %}

The plugins included in the YFM package are listed above. You can also [add additional](import.md) plugins or write your own using the [markdown-it guidelines](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/tree/master/docs).
